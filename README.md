🖼️ Gemini Image Understanding Application

📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive web application that uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze and describe images. Built with Streamlit, the app allows users to upload an image, optionally provide a text prompt, and receive a real-time response from the Gemini multimodal model. It showcases the power of combining natural language and visual input using generative AI.

🔍 Key Features

->Upload image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) directly from the interface.

->Optionally provide a custom prompt alongside the image.

->Real-time responses from Gemini 1.5 Flash multimodal model.

->Simple, responsive user interface built with Streamlit.

->Secure input for Google API key through the sidebar.


⚙️ How It Works

->The user inputs their Google API key in the sidebar.

->An image is uploaded through the file uploader.

->(Optional) A descriptive prompt can be added.

->On clicking "Tell me about the image", the app sends the image (and prompt) to Gemini.

->The model returns a textual description or analysis based on the visual and textual input.
